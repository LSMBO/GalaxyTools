dN-TOP Validation Tool is designed to extract peptide pairs with two different chemical derivatizations from an export coming from Proline Studio (http://proline.profiproteomics.fr/, ProFI, French Proteomics Infrastructure).

It was developed to automate our light/heavy TMPP-based N-terminomics workflow, dN-TOP, and can also be used for any other mass adducts or PTMs. A couple of light and heavy TMPP-derivatized peptides is validated only if the identification of the light/heavy pair of the same peptide sequence, with identical modifications and close elution time is made. N-termini positions are validated only if the spectra used for the identification provides an unambiguous peptide sequence and, if any, the exact position of a modification. Validated couples of light and heavy TMPP-derivatized peptides are extracted and listed on a new sheet and the unicity of the peptide sequence in the searched database is indicated.
