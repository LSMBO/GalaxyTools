# Fasta36

Program: Fasta36 Effective protein sequence comparaison

Goal: To identify statistically significant sequence similarity that can be used to infer homology

Compares the sequences from the query file with those provided in the library. If you provide a taxonomy ID, the corresponding fasta file will be downloaded from Uniprot-SwissProt.
